---metal orange roadmap---
minimum "shippable" game:
- game engine fully implemented
- all powerups
- ~20 levels

high priority:
- between level animated cutscenes
- analog control
- 50 levels

nice to have:
- game saving
- sc-55 midi soundtrack (would probably need another disc)
- better intro text font (animated too)
